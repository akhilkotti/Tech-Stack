bitbucket pipeline to automate the build for develop repository
===============================================================
- create a bitbucket-pipelines.yml file in the root of your repository. 
- This YAML file defines the steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

bitbucket-pipelines.yml
=======================
	pipelines:
	  branches:
		develop:
		  - step:
			  name: Build and Test on Develop
			  caches:
				- maven
			  script:
				- mvn clean install
			  artifacts:
				- target/*.jar
		  - step:
			  name: Deploy to Development Server
			  deployment: development  # Marks this step as a deployment
			  script:
				- scp target/*.jar user@yourserver:/path/to/deploy/  # Replace with your actual server details
================================================================================
Explanation:
------------
	- develop: This pipeline runs only when there’s a push to the develop branch.
	- step:
		- name: A descriptive name for the step.
		- caches: Caches the Maven dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
		- script: The commands to execute during this step. Here, it runs mvn 
		          clean install to clean the project and build it.
		- artifacts: it keeps the built JAR file(s) in the target directory.
	- step:
		- name: A descriptive name for the step.
		- deployment: Some information for which branch you are doing deployment
		- script: This command helps in deploying the jar/war file from the target
		          directory to the server.

Setting Up SSH Keys
-------------------
	To allow Bitbucket Pipelines to access your server securely, you need to set up SSH keys:

	Generate SSH Key:
		On your local machine or in the Bitbucket Pipelines UI, generate an SSH key pair.
		
		Add the Public Key to the Server:
			Copy the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your target server.
		
		Add the Private Key to Bitbucket:
			Go to your Bitbucket repository settings.
			Navigate to Pipelines > SSH Keys.
			Add the private key there.

Note:
	After committing the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file to your repository, Bitbucket Pipelines will automatically trigger a build whenever you push changes to the develop branch.
