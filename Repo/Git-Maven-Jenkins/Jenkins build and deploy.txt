jenkins installation configuration for auto build and deployment of java project
================================================================================
To set up Jenkins for automated build and deployment of a Java project on a Windows machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Jenkins
	Download the Jenkins installer for Windows from the Jenkins official website.
	Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
	Once installed, Jenkins will run as a Windows service. You can access it through a web browser at http://localhost:8080.
2. Initial Setup and Unlock Jenkins
	During the initial setup, Jenkins will prompt you for an unlock key. This key is available in the file at C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword.
	Copy and paste the key into Jenkins to proceed with the setup.
	Install the recommended plugins when prompted.
3. Install Java and Configure JDK in Jenkins
	Ensure Java is installed on your system. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation path.
	In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.
	Scroll down to JDK and click Add JDK. Uncheck Install automatically and provide the path to your local JDK.
4. Install Maven (If Required)
	If your project uses Maven, download and install Maven on your Windows machine.
	Set the MAVEN_HOME environment variable and add Maven’s bin directory to the PATH.
	In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration and configure Maven under the Maven section.
5. Create a New Jenkins Job
	Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on New Item.
	Enter a name for your job and select Freestyle project, then click OK.
6. Configure Source Code Management (SCM)
	In the job configuration page, scroll down to the Source Code Management section.
	Choose Git and provide the repository URL.
	Add credentials if the repository is private.
7. Configure Build Triggers
	Scroll to the Build Triggers section.
	Enable Poll SCM if you want Jenkins to check for changes in the repository at regular intervals.
	Alternatively, you can use GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling if you have a GitHub webhook configured.
8. Configure the Build
	Scroll to the Build section.
	If you're using Maven, add a Invoke top-level Maven targets build step. Specify goals like clean install.
	For plain Java projects, you might use a Execute Windows batch command build step to run commands like:
	cmd
	Copy code
	javac -d bin src\*.java
	java -cp bin MainClass
	Alternatively, you can use Gradle or Ant depending on your project.
9. Configure Post-Build Actions
	Scroll to Post-build Actions.
	If you want to deploy the build artifacts, you can add a Send build artifacts over SSH or Archive the artifacts step.
	You can also configure deployment scripts to run after the build completes.
10. Configure Deployment (Optional)
	If you need Jenkins to automatically deploy the build, you can add deployment steps in the Post-build Actions.
	This could involve copying files to a deployment server, running scripts, or using tools like Ansible.
11. Save and Build
	Click Save to store the job configuration.
	You can now build the job manually by clicking Build Now or let it run automatically based on the triggers you configured.
12. Monitor Builds
	Monitor the progress and results of the builds in the Jenkins dashboard.
	You can configure Jenkins to send notifications (e.g., via email or Slack) if a build fails or succeeds.
13. Setting Up Windows Services or Batch Scripts
	If your deployment requires starting/stopping services on Windows, you can use Windows batch command steps to manage them.
	Example batch commands:
	cmd
	Copy code
	net stop MyService
	xcopy /y build\*.jar \\deployment-server\path\
	net start MyService
This setup should provide a solid foundation for automating builds and deployments of a Java project on a Windows machine using Jenkins.
