Certainly! Automating the sending of daily email reports with Python can be done using several libraries and tools. Below, I'll walk you through a basic script using `smtplib` for sending emails and `schedule` for scheduling daily tasks.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Your Environment**

   First, you need to make sure you have the required libraries. You can install `schedule` if you don’t already have it:

   ```bash
   pip install schedule
   ```

2. **Create the Email Sending Script**

   Below is a sample script that sends an email with a daily report. This example uses Gmail’s SMTP server, but you can adjust it to any other email provider by changing the SMTP settings.

   ```python
   import smtplib
   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText
   from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
   from email import encoders
   import schedule
   import time

   def send_email(subject, body, to_email, attachment_path=None):
       # Email credentials
       from_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
       password = "your-email-password"
       
       # Create the email
       msg = MIMEMultipart()
       msg['From'] = from_email
       msg['To'] = to_email
       msg['Subject'] = subject
       
       # Attach the body
       msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
       
       # Attach a file if provided
       if attachment_path:
           attachment = open(attachment_path, "rb")
           part = MIMEBase('application', 'octet-stream')
           part.set_payload(attachment.read())
           encoders.encode_base64(part)
           part.add_header('Content-Disposition', f'attachment; filename={attachment_path}')
           msg.attach(part)
           attachment.close()
       
       # Connect to the SMTP server
       with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
           server.starttls()  # Upgrade the connection to a secure encrypted SSL/TLS connection
           server.login(from_email, password)
           text = msg.as_string()
           server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, text)
       
       print("Email sent!")

   def daily_report():
       subject = "Daily Report"
       body = "Here is the daily report."
       to_email = "recipient@example.com"
       attachment_path = "report.pdf"  # Optional, set to None if no attachment
       send_email(subject, body, to_email, attachment_path)

   # Schedule the task to run daily at 8 AM
   schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(daily_report)

   while True:
       schedule.run_pending()
       time.sleep(60)  # Wait for one minute
   ```

3. **Configure Your Script**

   * Replace `"your-email@gmail.com"` and `"your-email-password"` with your actual email credentials.
   * Replace `"recipient@example.com"` with the recipient’s email address.
   * Modify `"report.pdf"` to the path of the report file you want to attach, or set it to `None` if you don’t want to attach a file.
   * Set the `schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(daily_report)` to the time you want the email to be sent. The time should be in 24-hour format.

4. **Running the Script**

   Save the script to a file, e.g., `daily_email_report.py`. You can run this script in the background on your server or local machine using:

   ```bash
   python daily_email_report.py
   ```

5. **Considerations**

   * **Security**: For production use, consider using environment variables or a configuration file for storing email credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into your script.
   * **Email Provider Limits**: Be aware of limits imposed by your email provider on sending emails to avoid getting flagged for spam.
   * **Error Handling**: Add error handling to manage issues like failed connections or invalid credentials.

This script is a basic example and can be expanded with additional features such as dynamic report generation, more sophisticated error handling, or logging. Let me know if you need more details on any part of the setup!
