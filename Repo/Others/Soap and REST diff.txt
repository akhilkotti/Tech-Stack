SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are two different approaches to web services that allow communication between systems over the web. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. **Protocol vs. Architecture**

* **SOAP**: SOAP is a protocol. It defines a strict set of rules for structuring messages and uses XML as its message format. It also has built-in error handling and supports stateful operations (maintaining sessions).
* **REST**: REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. It is based on a set of guidelines and principles for creating scalable web services. RESTful services typically use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are stateless.

### 2. **Message Format**

* **SOAP**: Always uses XML for its message format. The XML is wrapped in a SOAP envelope and may include headers, body, and fault elements.
* **REST**: Can use multiple formats including JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text, though JSON is most commonly used due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.

### 3. **Transport Protocols**

* **SOAP**: Can operate over multiple transport protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, or even JMS (Java Message Service).
* **REST**: Primarily relies on HTTP/HTTPS as the transport protocol.

### 4. **Complexity**

* **SOAP**: More complex due to its strict standards and additional features like WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, etc.
* **REST**: Simpler and more flexible, making it easier to develop and integrate with various systems.

### 5. **Performance**

* **SOAP**: Generally slower due to the overhead of processing XML and the additional information included in the SOAP envelope.
* **REST**: Usually faster since it typically uses lightweight formats like JSON and has less overhead.

### 6. **Security**

* **SOAP**: Has built-in security features like WS-Security, which supports things like message integrity and confidentiality.
* **REST**: Security must be handled through HTTPS, OAuth, or other security mechanisms external to the REST architecture.

### 7. **Use Cases**

* **SOAP**: Ideal for enterprise-level applications requiring a high level of security, reliability, and complex operations. It’s commonly used in payment gateways, financial services, etc.
* **REST**: Preferred for web and mobile applications, and other lightweight, scalable services. It’s used widely in modern web services like social media, e-commerce, etc.

### 8. **Statefulness**

* **SOAP**: Can be stateful (supports maintaining sessions over multiple requests).
* **REST**: Stateless (each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request).

### Summary:

* **SOAP** is more rigid, with a higher learning curve and is suited for complex, enterprise-level operations.
* **REST** is more flexible, faster, easier to use, and better suited for web-based applications.
